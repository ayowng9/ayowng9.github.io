        <li><em>“This class enhanced my critical-thinking skills and my ability to see the law in American society through a different lens.”</em></li>

        <li><em>"I have really enjoyed taking this class. I liked how the assignments were due on Wednesday because it made me feel like I had a little more time to do them because everything else is due on Sundays. Another thing I really enjoyed was her feedback on the grading. She always told us why we lost points and what we could do to fix it. She also told us all of the things we did correct."</em></li>
        <li><em>"She's an amazing professor."</em></li>
        <li><em>"I was very apprehensive about taking this class. I knew nothing about government and no real interest. That in itself I knew would be a barrier in doing well with this course. I am pleased to say that that feeling has subsided. The course has been more interesting than I thought. The course was laid out with very well detailed expectations and guidelines. It was organized, which is what I really needed. The instructor was very knowledgeable, helpful, patient, and willing to help however she could. I am in hopes that the rest of my online class experiences will be just half the structure this course has been. Thank you for all you do, the passion you show in your teaching, and the care you have for the success of your students"</em></li>
