        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale ‚Äî a Research 1 (R1) institution (Expected Graduation: December 2025), and an <b>Adjunct Faculty</b> in Government at Southeastern Illinois College. I study American politics, and my research interests include political behavior, political communications, public policy and democracy, elections and election law, and comparative perspectives. I specialize in computational methods, drawing on diverse data sources from surveys to historical records.
        </p>
       <p>
          I am The Academy Fellow at the Heritage Foundation‚Äôs Young Leaders Program and a Fellow of the Young African Leadership Initiative (YALI) by the U.S. Department of State. Previously, I was an Assistant Editor-in-Chief for the <em>Journal of Statesmanship and Public Policy</em>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Research Interests</h3>
        <p>
          My dissertation research examines how time spent in the United States shapes immigrants‚Äô partisan strength ‚Äî a key but often overlooked dimension in understanding political development. I argue that years lived in the U.S. is the most powerful and consistent predictor of partisan strength among immigrants, more so than age or time in the electorate.

       <div class="conference-grid">
  <div class="conference-box">
    <span class="letter">A ‚Äî Ask Questions  </span>
    <p>Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask questions‚Äîthe worst you‚Äôll hear is ‚Äúno.‚Äù Inquire about funding opportunities from conference organizers or your institution. As a grad student, any opportunity to cut costs is valuable!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="conference-box">
    <span class="letter">B ‚Äî Be Ready to Network </span>
    <p> Networking is one of the key benefits of attending a conference. Be prepared to introduce yourself to as many people (from students to renowned professors), engage in conversations, and make connections that can help your research and career. You may find co-authors, job opportunities, referrals, or speaking invitations.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="conference-box">
    <span class="letter">C ‚Äî Come with a Plan </span>
    <p>From the agenda, find events or sessions most relevant to your interests and goals. Create a schedule to ensure you attend those key events‚Äîand try to visit the exhibition halls.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="conference-box">
    <span class="letter">D ‚Äî Don‚Äôt Feed the Impostor Syndrome</span>
    <p> Don‚Äôt let self-doubt hold you back. Your work was accepted for a reason‚Äîyou‚Äôre qualified and capable. Whether you‚Äôre presenting or attending, embrace the opportunity with confidence!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="conference-box">
    <span class="letter">E ‚Äî Engage with Resources Available</span>
    <p> Maximize memberships, discounts, and other resources before and after the conference. Many memberships last a year (some two years) and provide extra networking and materials.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="conference-box">
    <span class="letter">F  ‚Äî Follow Up </span>
    <p>After the conference, reach out to the people you met. A short follow-up helps solidify connections and maintain professional relationships.</p>
  </div>
</div>
      </details>

      <div class="callout">
        Conferences can be intense, from paper writing to slides hours before your talk. Make the most of the chance to
        expand your knowledge and network, and don‚Äôt forget to enjoy the experience.

      <h3>Maxims on Excellence: </h3>
    </header>

    <p class="center-quote">
  <em>‚ÄúPrinciples are ways of successfully dealing with reality to get what you want out of life.‚Äù ‚Äî Ray Dalio</em>
</p>


    <p>
      Driven by a lifelong commitment to learning, I have applied guiding principles that continue to shape my journey. Staying diligent with these maxims has brought meaningful results, reinforcing my commitment to deepening my contribution to knowledge, society, and meaningful work‚Äîbelieving excellence
      is a continuous, evolving pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are welcome to engage with my <strong>Maxims on Excellence</strong>, principles that guide both my work and my growth. Most of these came from deep meditations of the heart about <i>life</i> and the place of all beings within it. Find a section that piques your interest or your current state of affairs; I can assure you that you will not complete the section the same person as you started. If it motivates you that much, you may find interest in other sections. Have a happy read!

          <li>For the diligent man, know when to <i>quit</i>.</li>
          <li>‚ÄúQuitting..does not make you a weakling. Neither does it mean that you are conceited, arrogant and full of yourself...Contrary to that, sometimes, quitting is a sign of responsibility and maturity. It could be a sign that you value the seed that God deposited within you and are willing to get rid of the thorns of distraction that would choke the seed. Sometimes, quitting could end up being a pointer to the fact that you are committed to nurturing that seed into a plant that yields its increase [immeasurably].‚Äù ‚Äî Dr. Promise Tewogbola</li>
          <li>Not every gifts (things or service) are good gifts. Some gifts allow unnecessary exemptions that steals your integrity, conscience, conditions for your growth, and your ability to drive influence.</li>

  <p>
    As an academic, I engage pedagogy and dive into research, but when the books close, I open new worlds‚Äîwriting stories that spark wonder in young minds.
    I desire for every young mind to understand self-worth and an appreciation for the worth of others and the world around them.
