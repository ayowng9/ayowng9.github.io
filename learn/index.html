      <summary>Alphabets (A–F) of Preparing for a Conference (In-Person)</summary>
       <div class="conference-grid">
  <div class="conference-box">
    <span class="letter">A — Ask Questions  </span>
    <p>Don’t hesitate to ask questions—the worst you’ll hear is “no.” Inquire about funding opportunities from conference organizers or your institution. As a grad student, any opportunity to cut costs is valuable!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="conference-box">
    <span class="letter">B — Be Ready to Network </span>
    <p> Networking is one of the key benefits of attending a conference. Be prepared to introduce yourself to as many people (from students to renowned professors), engage in conversations, and make connections that can help your research and career. You may find co-authors, job opportunities, referrals, or speaking invitations.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="conference-box">
    <span class="letter">C — Come with a Plan </span>
    <p>From the agenda, find events or sessions most relevant to your interests and goals. Create a schedule to ensure you attend those key events—and try to visit the exhibition halls.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="conference-box">
    <span class="letter">D — Don’t Feed the Impostor Syndrome</span>
    <p> Don’t let self-doubt hold you back. Your work was accepted for a reason—you’re qualified and capable. Whether you’re presenting or attending, embrace the opportunity with confidence!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="conference-box">
    <span class="letter">E — Engage with Resources Available</span>
    <p> Maximize memberships, discounts, and other resources before and after the conference. Many memberships last a year (some two years) and provide extra networking and materials.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="conference-box">
    <span class="letter">F  — Follow Up </span>
    <p>After the conference, reach out to the people you met. A short follow-up helps solidify connections and maintain professional relationships.</p>
  </div>
</div>
      </details>

      <div class="callout">
        Conferences can be intense, from paper writing to slides hours before your talk. Make the most of the chance to
        expand your knowledge and network, and don’t forget to enjoy the experience.

      <h3>Maxims on Excellence: </h3>
    </header>

    <p class="center-quote">
  <em>“Principles are ways of successfully dealing with reality to get what you want out of life.” — Ray Dalio</em>
</p>


    <p>
      Driven by a lifelong commitment to learning, I have applied guiding principles that continue to shape my journey. Staying diligent with these maxims has brought meaningful results, reinforcing my commitment to deepening my contribution to knowledge, society, and meaningful work—believing excellence
      is a continuous, evolving pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are welcome to engage with my <strong>Maxims on Excellence</strong>, principles that guide both my work and my growth. Most of these came from deep meditations of the heart about <i>life</i> and the place of all beings within it. Find a section that piques your interest or your current state of affairs; I can assure you that you will not complete the section the same person as you started. If it motivates you that much, you may find interest in other sections. Have a happy read!

        <summary>On Cultivating a Champion’s Mindset</summary>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>The best of men are still men.</li> 
          <li>Embrace curiosity as the foundation of growth.</li>
          <li>“The world is your oyster.” — Stranger & Navy Veteran (2016)</li>
          <li>Strive for progress over perfection—excellence is a journey.</li>
          <li>When you show up, be competitive.</li>
          <li>“Life is filled with glorious opportunities brilliantly disguised as insoluble problems.” — Jerry Falwell Sr.</li>
          <li>When in doubt, go to the library.</li>
          <li>The more answers you have, the more questions you discover.</li>
          <li>“The only thing that’s new is the history we don’t know.” There’s always more to work on.</li>
          <li>Perfectionist when the price is right; otherwise, results are God’s.</li>
          <li>Never let wins get to your head or losses to your heart—deflect every glory to God...and know, the God who takes the glory takes the shame too, if your "shame" came out of obedience to Him. </li>
          <li>Information consumes attention; attention requires presence; presence dissolves ego.</li>
          <li>Your confidence is His faithfulness.</li>
          <li>Envy is often a symptom of unacknowledged desire. Let honor be the cure.</li>
          <li>If you dont know a man’s story, dont envy their result. Behind every glory, there is a story.</li>
          <li>Everything in the Kingdom finds its value to the degree that it is connected to its purpose.</li>

        <summary>On Journey to Purpose and Becoming</summary>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>“To have meaning in your life is better than to have what you want.” — Jordan Peterson</li>
          <li>“You ain’t been nobody until you’ve been yourself.” — A stranger, 2024</li>
          <li>Define what matters. Decide how to protect it.</li>
          <li>Fight for what you believe is important, even when it does not come easy or seem likely. A happy home, a house full of love, and a fulfilled family is earned. You fight for those things as much as you fight for a healthy body.</li>
          <li>Home is whatever you call it. Home is what you make of it.</li>
          <li>Home is not home if home is the mouth of a shark - Warsan Shire.</li>
          <li>Strange experiences require strange people.</li>
          <li>Surround yourself with people you can trust to see clearly when your vision is blurred.</li>
          <li>Work is worship; hustling isn’t.</li>
          <li>Spend your life working hard to enjoy that life you have been blessed with.</li>
          <li>Live as though time is passing. It is anyway.</li>
          <li>Being a good person is not enough; The distance between a good man and his destiny is (=) <i>ignorance</i>.</li>
          <li>Faith is the foundation of trust. Trust is the foundation of communication.</li>
          <li>Even if you want to <i>lie</i> to others, don’t lie to yourself | “To thine own self, be true.”</li>
          <li>Two thoughts from John Adams; "The longer I live, the more I read, the more patiently I think, and the more anxiously I inquire, the less I seem to know...Do justly. Love mercy. Walk humbly. This is enough...& I say, that Power must never be trusted without a check.”</li>
          <li>All your suffering can't help or redeem someone who doesn't want to be helped or redeemed. Not even Christ's suffering could do that. Don't suffer unnecessarily where it does no good.</li>
          <li>Comfort kills growth.</li>
          <li>“Work for what you believe in, but pick your battles, and don’t burn your bridges. Don’t be afraid to take charge, think about what you want, then do the work, but then enjoy what makes you happy, bring along your crew, have a sense of humor.” — RBG</li>
          <li>Big fish/small pond vs. small fish/big pond — both are good depending on seasons and perspective.</li>
          <li>“If you’re not in the arena getting your <s>ass</s> kicked for being brave, I am not interested or open to your feedback about my work” — Theodore Roosevelt</li>
          <li>“Grace is for salvation. Hard work is for graduation.” — A prof.</li>

          <li>“Quitting..does not make you a weakling.

      <h3>Children Books: </h3>
    </header>

  <p>
    As an academic, I engage pedagogy and dive into research, but when the books close, I open new worlds—writing stories that spark wonder in young minds.
    I desire for every young mind to understand self-worth and an appreciation for the worth of others and the world around them.
